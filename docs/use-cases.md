# Use Cases

There are quite a few common game dev use cases where a library like this could be useful:

## Saving / Loading Player Data

The most common example is taking your player data and saving/loading it.

## Populating In Memory Databases

If you have a game with an inventory, you probably have a database of items (be it a flat file, an actual DB, web call etc), so you can make a pipeline to extract this data and convert it into a list of items.

## Saving Custom Levels/Content

If you have a game where users can take pictures or create their own levels and that data needs to be put somewhere, you can create a pipeline for this to take the level and store it somewhere for later.

Almost all scenarios which revolve around data needing to go somewhere and come out of somewhere can be covered through a pipeline.
